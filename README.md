#issues
 - There is a bug somewhere we are not able to find, which make the program to stop during the gameprogress. We suspect it has maybe to do with the sound added, or the way it is added but do not know anything for certain. Luckily there is a save-game function you can use in these cases. If you save and reload the game you can go on...
 - Many methods are handling ether graphics or arrays and hard to add "side-effect" testing on. If there would me more time maybe could have added more but took the decision that it is better to have just a few and concentrate on the rest.
