#issues
 - There is a bug somewhere we are not able to find, which make the program freeze during the game progress. We suspect it may have to do with the sound added, or the way it is added with threads but do not know anything for certain. Luckily there is a save-game function you can use in these cases. If you save and reload the game you can continue...
 - Many methods are handling either graphics or arrays and is hard to add "side-effect" testing on. If there would be more time maybe we could have added more tests, but we took the decision that it is better to have just a few and concentrate on the rest.
 - Also, due to lack of time, some features we would like to add are missing, such as multiplayer-mode, handle the outcome of a draw and having the computer opponent shoot in a more realistic way, other than continue to shoot at random, when a ship has been hit.
